## Preamble

    Idea: 000-status-index
    Title: Status Index
    Status: Draft
    Created: 2018-04-27

## Summary

We have a growing number of very useful standalone webpages that are providing valuable
informations and services. 

Examples of those are:
- cluster visualization,
- cluster status,
- history of the #status channel on the different whisper networks,
- nightly build QR codes page (https://status-im.github.io/nightly/)
- status.im people list (https://rawgit.com/jacqueswww/b5460887fe86871434dcef833fa00c92/raw/status_people.html)
- documentation

The goal of this swarm is to build an index of these pages so that they can be listed
and easily accessed from a single place. We also want to make sure that each of these
pages are documented to make it easy to reproduce them or for someone other than their
creator to contribute.

## Product Overview

The purpose of this Swarm is to build an index of all the standalone webpages that 
have been built by various members of the team and should be made accessible via a 
simple single directory page. We will evaluate cloud/container provider to host/run 
those websites as well.

It also aims at pushing production of documentation to make it easier to contribute to
this projects and troubleshoot them.

### User Stories

> What user stories are you solving?
As as status core developper, I have troubles with messaging, I suspect the cluster
to be responsible, I want to be able to go to index.status.im and find the page that
will show me the current status of the cluster.

As a status community member, I want to create a bot that interacts with status clients
with status communication protocol. I want to be able to easily find the documentation 
of the communication protocol by checking index.status.im

As a status community member, I want to improve the static website rendering status
ideas repository. I want to be able to check on index.status.im and find the documentation
on how this website is built so that I can contribute.
