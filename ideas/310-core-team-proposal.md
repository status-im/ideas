# Core Team
## Summary and Goal(s)
Status Core is responsible for implementing a decentralized, reliable Ethereum reference client for Mobile on Android and iOS. This client should provide a reliable communication medium and ability to access the open decentralized web.

Core team also sets up the design direction for the mobile app.

Desktop is out of scope, as is protocol research. Whitepaper use case implementation is partly in scope, partly not, depending on specifics and other teams.

Core needs an accountable, passionate get-shit-done mentality and drive, in contrast to the meandering blame-shifting.


## Additional contibutors
- Andrei M (Design)
- Serhy/Anna/Nastya(QA)

## Scope

Core should focus on problems/features that require multidisciplinary understanding and influence the application architecture. With the highest priority of making Status a usable application for consumption.


### Active Swarms
* [Network Incentivization Swarm](./313-core-networking.md)
* [Core Improvements Swarm](./315-core-improvements.md)


## Communications
(required)
`status channel`:[`#status-core`](http://get.status.im/chat/public/status-core).
`sync frequency`: Weekly Sync, Monday 10am CET
`meeting notes`: [this running doc on notes.status.im](https://notes.status.im/sm7x7tPpQESkRwu7YNFzSQ)


### Process
Weekly sync-up calls
- goals for the week
- focus area, progress

Each project that is currently active should have an umbrella issue that should
link all the other issues. It contains a full description of the project and is
closed when the project is considered "done".

Some high-level discussions might also happen there.

This issue should contain all the other issues grouped into areas if necessary.

Each project should contain **Vision**, **Scope** and **Tradeoffs**.
1. Vision: a high-level goal of the project or a problem we are trying to solve.
2. Scope: limiting conditions that we empose on ourselves when implementing the project (what it is doing and what it is NOT doing).
3. Tradeoffs: a lot of projects can contain tradeoffs that make is feasible to implement. These should be documented there.

See [status-react#6757](https://github.com/status-im/status-react/issues/6757) as an example of a similar issue.

The projects list should have links to umbrella issues for each projects.
