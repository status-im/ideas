## Preamble

    Idea: 121-swarm-compensation
    Title: Swarm Compensation
    Status: In Progress
    Created: 2018-04-02
    Related: `120-swarm-process`

## Summary
Swarms are ephemeral teams forming to achieve a specified goal and disbanding once achieved or failure becomes apparent.

Ultimately we would like Status to become a public good, owned, developed and ran by it's very own users. In order to achieve that we need to open up our processes for contributions from "the outside" and establish ways for users to propose & incentivise projects/Swarms they see as important.

Compensating contributors for their work is an important component of this and where `120-swarm-process` focuses on establishing a baseline of processes that are open to everyone this idea will focus on experimentally devising compensation mechanisms. 

## Swarm Participants

- Lead Contributor: @martinklepsch
- Evaluation ('compensation criteria'): Voting mechanism (Polly survey)
- Contributor: @oskarth

## Product Overview

This swarm will define **four** experimental compensation mechanisms and recruit upcoming swarms to participate in this experiment.

The compensation mechanisms should be judged according to the following criteria:

- **Fairness** — if we're not fair we will fail to retain contributors
- **Ease of use** — we want to ship a new kind of platform, not get bogged down in "paperwork"
- **More attractive than salary** — as outlined in `120-swarm-process` there are two types of swarms:
	- **`Type-1`** is the ideal, defined, ran and compensated by the community
	- **`Type-2`** is the currently predominant form. Defined, ran and compensated by employees of Status, the company.
	- While coming up with a nice model for `Type-1` swarms we also would like to encourage every Status employee to participate in similar ways as community contributors.

## Checkpoints

#### Checkpoint 1 — `2018-04-06`

- Define at least two compensation models
- Talk to #peopleops how we can admin/structure this
- Reach out to upcoming swarms and convince them to participate  

#### Checkpoint 2 — `2018-04-20`

- Define two more compensation models
- Again, reach out and convince upcoming swarms

#### Checkpoint 3 — `2018-05-31`

- Summarize learnings and archive them in ideas repository.
- Write up what these learnings mean for the OpenBounty project specifically and how they should affect the development of the product.

## Exit Criteria

Conduct four experiments and evaluate them based on the criteria outlined above. Give recommendation on what kind of compensation mechanism should be enabled by Status OpenBounty.

## Metrics Affected

### SNT Utility

Allowing SNT holders to directly support changes will expand the utility of SNT tokens.

### OpenBounty Transaction Volume

While these experimental compensation payouts likely won't happen through the OpenBounty platform these transactions could still be counted as part of OpenBounty as they will ultimately inform what compensation models will find their way into OpenBounty.
