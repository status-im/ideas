- Beside the text field the menu for requesting a transaction appears.
- *User A* selects the menu entry `/request`
- A menu listing the supported currencies appears.
- The user selects the wanted currency.
- The text field displays the request command as well as the currency.
- It expects *User A* to enter the amount.
